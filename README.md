# A simplified Jira clone built with Angular, Akita and ng-zorro

## Setting up development environment üõ†

- `git clone https://github.com/trungk18/jira-clone-angular.git`
- `cd jira-clone-angular`
- `npm start` for angular web application
- The app should run on `http://localhost:4200/`

### Unit/Integration tests üß™

I skipped writing test for this project. I might do it for the proper backend GraphQL API.

## Compatibility

It was being tested on IE 11, Chrome and Firefox. For Safari, there are some minor alignment issues.
